How do i build a mutimdia user exp
desing proccess
    content produced using disparate software/hardware
    dawing/animation
    word process
    image cap with scan
    sound recording
experinince produced using authoring tools

card based
experince consisits of 2D pages (page-based)
elements arranged in the way text and images are laid out in books and magazines
    text, images, videos , sound
time-based elements
    occupy a fixed space
    controls to start/stop playback
links between pages
eg
powerpoint, web pages (html)

event based
experince is event driven system
    user does something and something happens in response
    contemporary GUIs
associating actiobs with event
events initiated by user
actions predefined or scripted
authoring via programming languages

time based
time is the organising principle
elements arranged on a timeline
may still incorporate some user control
historically, tools such as Apple's hypercard and adobe flash were time-based tools for web and standalone presnentaions
these have superseded by web based ux in html5 and frameworks built on html5

the complelte experince
actually most ux contains aspects of all three orgnisational style
    elements laid out in space
    elements change under user control
    elements change over time
deve proccess may consider different aspect in sequence eg web pages
    layout content of web pages in space
    add inks to create interactivity
