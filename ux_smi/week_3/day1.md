how multimedia deliver as a user experience
offline
    -installations / kiosks / interactive tables/
        single site with known hardware
    -software download / DVD / flash drive /
        multiple sites with no control over target hardware
    online
    communication over networks
    limited bandwidth
    user may require suitable software
    mobile app or browser plug-in
    feedback and interaction possible


delivery methods
    internet
        potentially accessed by huge audience
        access can be very slow
        -steaming rech for audio and video
        two way traffic possible
        -email, forms for feedback
        easily updated
        ISP will charge produce by bandwidth usage
        -unless produce has own (expensive) web server
        ongoing costs to user for internet access
        additional commercial opportinites
        -ads, mailing lists

delivery methods methods
    internet
        (fast) local area network with own web server
        known user technology  (consider bandwidth and browser)
        secure
    kiosk
        fixed install with produce-spec hardware
        hard disks provide high bandwidth and (unlimited) storage
        must be reliable (perhaps 24 hours a day)
    electronic presentations
        maybe stored on laptop pc or touch-screen tablet
        data projector

How do i build a mutimdia user exp
desing proccess
    content produced using disparate software/hardware
    dawing/animation
    word process
    image cap with scan
    sound recording
experinince produced using authoring tools

card based
experince consisits of 2D pages (page-based)
elements arranged in the way text and images are laid out in books and magazines
    text, images, videos , sound
time-based elements
    occupy a fixed space
    controls to start/stop playback
links between pages
eg
powerpoint, web pages (html)

event based
experince is event driven system
    user does something and something happens in response
    contemporary GUIs
associating actions with event
events initiated by user
actions predefined or scripted
authoring via programming languages

time based
time is the organising principle
elements arranged on a timeline
may still incorporate some user control
historically, tools such as Apple's hypercard and adobe flash were time-based tools for web and standalone presnentaions
these have superseded by web based ux in html5 and frameworks built on html5

the complelte experince
actually most ux contains aspects of all three organisational style
    elements laid out in space
    elements change under user control
    elements change over time
deve process may consider different aspect in sequence eg web pages
    layout content of web pages in space
    add inks to create interactivity

<div>

mutimedia with html
