layers
the in between

input
hidden :are in between of input and output process
output

activation function

weights connections

bias nodes

some examples
predicting levels of sales 
predicting wether or not it will rain based on current humidity
predicting the colour of pottery glaze based on a mixture of base pigments

prepare
split
reach each row
make a prediction
update the weights
present the next example
repeat

NO MATH CALC IS NEEDED FOR US

hyperparameters
the search for best validation error requries a serach over hypermeters
learning rate and learning rate decay

advantages of neural nets
very powerful predictors
can cope with non linear relationships
able to generalise to data that it has not seen before

dis
how predi ar can be hard to be understand by human
not easy to ask why an answer was given
no rules to look at
can make big errors if not trained properly
