neural networks
multiple layers of networks
hidden layers

units, nodes, nueorun

layers
the in between

input
hidden :are in between of input and output process
output

activation function

weights connections

bias nodes

some examples
predicting levels of sales 
predicting weather or not it will rain based on current humidity
predicting the color of pottery glaze based on a mixture of base pigments

prepare
split
reach each row
make a prediction
update the weights
present the next example
repeat

NO MATH CALC IS NEEDED FOR US

hyperparameters
the search for best validation error requires a search over hyperparameters
learning rate and learning rate decay
batch sze
initial random weights range
momentum
action func
various reg

advantages of neural nets
very powerful predictors
can cope with non linear relationships
able to generalize to data that it has not seen before

dis
how predi ar can be hard to be understand by human
not easy to ask why an answer was given
no rules to look at
can make big errors if not trained properly
