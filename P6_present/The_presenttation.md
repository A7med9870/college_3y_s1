Detail all the ways a cetain bug could be recreated
with steps on how that happens, and a conculsion on what it does to the running logic

QA team importance in any software

Doing out of box testing

-Alert systems in place

-Observing the logs

---
how to do QA in solo dev

-YouTube channel %% that where you document the progress and the challenges; as well address the feedback you get in the comments, as that will create the relationship between who wants to try the project and the dev behind it
 %%
 
-Screenshots your codes and save it somewhere %% with comments; for any time you have to re-address old code; without breaking a lot of the game in the process %%

-(Not recommended) Send your project files precompiled to people Dms in the internet (example: Discord)

how to do QA in team

-Organize days where the team sits down and stress test the project together

%% (Photo of 5v5 pcs next to each other, for when a group of devs had for testing their game) %%

---
QA in large teams

-here where there is an entire department that would keep beta testing patches and provide issues and how to recreate them; in a detailed manner

for the devs to fix later on

or

-there is the way of hiring an external company that has bug finders and QA teams/players; to provide into the original team company

---

#### Things where consider when doing QA in software design

-People who have considerable amount of knowledge in Code dev (people who regularly watch software related documentaries)

-People who at least understand the facts of the game's engine (have at least to use the game engine few times, even in basic terms)

-People who know how to redo what they find

-Keep a video record of the tests; log the tests into a console: for further debugging issues

Closing

QA is really important part of creating a software; you as a dev, don't want people to leave negative reviews and keep saying wasted potential; because you didn't test it enough

They are an integral part of software dev and should not be overlooked; after all, one of the main reasons of games like cyberpunk 2077 launched in awful state was under throwing the importance of QA
