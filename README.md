# class_notes_3y_s1

notes taken from classes
public for my colleges to look at the notes

recommended to use with obsidian; as the app that will read the notes and pdf files well; in combined with syncthing; you get the best to keep them updated between you machines

the "day_1" or "day_2" may not be really to dates; but rather to the day based on first or second time record of the subject class on that week
